This project aims to predict individuals' career paths using personality assessment models, including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Five Factor Model (FFM), and Big Five Inventory (BFI-10). The MBTI categorizes individuals into 16 personality types based on preferences in four dichotomies, while the FFM and BFI-10 assess personality across five dimensions. By analyzing personality traits, we aim to suggest career paths that align with individual traits, considering factors like extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. It's important to note that personality traits are just one aspect of career guidance, with other factors like interests, values, and skills playing a role. Our goal is to contribute to career prediction research and assist individuals in making informed career decisions.

## Five Factor Model (FFM)

The Big Five personality traits are a widely recognized categorization of personality into five key factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, often remembered as "OCEAN" or "CANOE." These traits help us understand and predict behavior in diverse contexts, including the workplace and social interactions.

The 5 traits are:

* Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
* Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
* Extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
* Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
* Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

## Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) 

MBTI is a self-report questionnaire in personality typology that gauges how individuals perceive the world and make decisions. It assesses preferences in four categories: introversion/extraversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving. Note that while popular, MBTI is considered pseudoscience by the scientific community.

The MBTI assesses personality traits based on 4 dichotomous pairs of preferences:

*	Extraversion (E) – Introversion (I)
*	Sensing (S) – Intuition (N)
*	Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)
*	Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

## BFI-10 (Big Five Inventory) 

The BFI-10 questionnaire is a set of questions used to assess an individual's personality traits based on their responses to ten items. Each item typically uses a rating scale (e.g., 1 to 5) for responses. After completing the questionnaire, scores for each of the Big Five personality dimensions (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) are calculated by summing the responses. Higher scores indicate a stronger presence of a trait, while lower scores suggest a lower presence.

## BFI-10 to MBTI Mapping 

The Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) assesses personality across five dimensions, while the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) categorizes personality types based on four dichotomies. Some research suggests possible connections between the two models, such as openness aligning with intuition, conscientiousness with judging, extraversion with extraversion, and agreeableness with feeling. However, these connections are not universally accepted, and the choice between the models depends on individual needs. The BFI-10 is a widely used and reliable tool for measuring personality traits. In summary, while there's ongoing debate and no formal mapping, further research could uncover potential correlations between these frameworks.
